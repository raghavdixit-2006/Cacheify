      {
        heading: 'The trade-offs',
        paragraphs: [
          'HTTP is not a drop-in replacement for RESP. This platform is not a RESP server, so native Redis clients cannot connect to it.

          'Blocking commands and pub/sub subscriptions do not fit a request/response contract. The supported surface is around sixty Redis-compatible commands across strings, lists, sets, hashes and sorted sets, plus cursor-based key browsing.

        paragraphs: [
          'Long-lived data needs an explicit expiry on each write, or a re-arm through the expire endpoint. Short-lived data should choose a TTL that matches its purpose rather than inheriting 24 hours by accident.',

Those responses tell an authenticated caller that the request was understood and refused, without revealing anything they did not already know.',
